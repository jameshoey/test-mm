## "If it works efficiently, we're not interested"

Welcome to NULL 2025, an annual (depending on how this one goes!) mini-conference presented as part of CO3101 Computers, Society and Professionalism. We will work together to produce several examples of poor UI design, highlighting principles of HCI that each breaks, and vote as a group for the best "worst" design. To make a submission (either individaully or as a group), follow the instructions on the <a href="https://jameshoey.github.io/test-mm/call/">Call for Papers page</a>. See details of the organising committee (or instructions to join!) on the <a href="https://jameshoey.github.io/test-mm/committee/">Committee page</a>. When the accepted submissions are ready, you will be able to find live demos and brief descriptions of each on the <a href="https://jameshoey.github.io/test-mm/proceedings/">Proceedings page</a>.
